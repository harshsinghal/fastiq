Hi, I'm Harsh.

I developed Fast IQ to speed up playing with LLMs from different providers and to avoid writing prompt boilerplate.

FastIQ is currently available on https://fastiq.netlify.app and runs in the browser. There is no server that is routing your queries to the chosen provider. The queries are sent directly from your browser to the LLM provider. 

All the logic is contained in the index.html file. You can just drop it into netlify.app and run your own version of FastIQ. 

You bring your own API keys from providers like Anyscale, TogetherAI, Groq and OpenAI and just get started. I've added a few task templates that help you get started.

I have a roadmap https://github.com/harshsinghal/fastiq/wiki/Roadmap and I'm excited to build these features over time.
