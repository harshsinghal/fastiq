Hi, I'm Harsh.

I developed Fast IQ to speed up playing with LLMs from different providers and to avoid writing prompt boilerplate.

FastIQ is currently available on https://fastiq.netlify.app and runs in the browser. 

You bring your own API keys from providers like Anyscale, TogetherAI, Groq and OpenAI and just get started. I've added a few task templates that help you get started.

I have a roadmap (see the Wiki) and will build this gradually.
